# go-libp2p-pubsub-grpc

gRPC libp2p pubsub API that uses `proto3`.

Some of the code is borrowed from [libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon/blob/master/pb/p2pd.proto) and [libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/tree/master/pb) modified to use proto3, and provide an API over gRPC.
